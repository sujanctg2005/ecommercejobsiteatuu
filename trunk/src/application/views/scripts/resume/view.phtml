	Currently, I am studying Masters in Computer Science in Uppsala University. I have had the great opportunity here as an international student, I have enjoyed my stay here as per my expectations. The way of proving education to students and the smooth interaction between professor and student is amazing in comparing to my home country, Nepal.
I have taken the relevant courses to my study here in Uppsala University, which will help me to work in the field of software development. Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, Programming in Java and Software Engineering are some of the subjects that I have taken here in Uppsala University.  I am sure that the pre-knowledge of these courses will help me to complete my second year of study smoothly in University of Copenhagen. Apart from these learning experiences I would like to discover the new side of being abroad as an international student.
I am interested in software development and game programming. I am now eager to continue advancing my knowledge by obtaining a practice related to my field. I believe it is a perfect chance to gain not only theoretical knowledge, but also to gain practical knowledge if I get the opportunity to take the courses offered by the University of Copenhagen. I have listed out the excerpts of the relevant courses that I have planned to take to meet my overall career objectives as an exchange student. Apart from providing me with state-of-the-art knowledge and skills, this course will help me to get a more concrete view on current topics and modern technology that would be a milestone in my career path. The joined forces of Department of Computer Science with the National Academy of Digital Interactive Entertainment on the computer game developer program approach me towards University of Copenhagen, which is also one of my fields of interest.
I hope to enroll in the MS Computer Science, as it will enable me to reach my intentions. The University’s high repute, comprehensive facilities and body of eminent faculty members doing quality research are in congruence with my interests and promise ambience conducive for me to fulfill my goals. I would be grateful to University of Copenhagen if I ‘m accorded the opportunity to pursue my graduate studies and am able to justify your faith in me.
